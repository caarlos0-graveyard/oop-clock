> OOP-ish implementation of the Clock Angle problem, with a Java EE REST endpoint.

This is the classic [Clock Angle Problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clock_angle_problem),
with a REST endpoint and the most OOP-ish API I was able to do.

### Packages:

- `api`: where I tried to do things in a "pure" OOP way;
- `app`: the Java EE stuff, not even close to pure OOP.

If you have any suggestion or you think my implementation is not "pure"
enough, I would love to discuss that. Please open an issue! :beers:
